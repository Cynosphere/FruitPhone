FruitPhone
=========
*What could your One Probe do if your One Probe was a Fruit Phoneâ„¢?*

Essentially a reference implementation for ProbeDataProviderAPI, though it
doubles as an extra I M M E R S I V E alternative to Waila, through its Fruit
Phone item, which you hold in your hand and the data is actually on the screen.

It also acts as an alternative frontend for Waila, as it includes a Waila shim.
A TheOneProbe shim was attempted but is quite difficult due to how rigid that
API is. PRs accepted.

Yes, making things render on the item required a lot of ugly hacks. Would've
been really easy and clean in 1.7 with render hooks. *glares*
